# artificialLifeSimulator
Simple artificial life simulator coded in Java

This simple simulator allows the user to create a new world with a grid size, and food and obstacle density, of their own choosing. 
The user can then create multiple lifeforms, either carnivore or herbivore, which will move around searching for appropriate food.
The life forms can die if they run out of energy.
Certain simulation variables are also available to be modified whilst running the simulation as well.
